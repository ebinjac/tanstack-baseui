# Welcome to Ensemble

Ensemble is a unified portal for engineering and operations teams. It brings together shift management, performance metrics, and resource organization into a single, premium experience.

> [!NOTE]
> If this is your first time, start with the [Onboarding Guide](/docs/onboarding) to register your team and get access.

## Core Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Scorecard](/docs/scorecard) | Track application health, availability, and volume metrics |
| [Turnover (TO-HUB)](/docs/turnover) | Manage shift handovers with structured entries |
| [Link Manager](/docs/link-manager) | Centralize your team's bookmarks and critical URLs |
| [Admin](/docs/admin) | System management for platform administrators |

## How Ensemble Works

Ensemble is **team-centric**. Once you register a team, all tools — Scorecard, Turnover, Link Manager — operate within your team's workspace. You can switch between different teams using the Team Switcher in the navigation header.
