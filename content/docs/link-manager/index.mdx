# Link Manager

The **Link Manager** is your team's curated bookmark repository. It centralizes all important URLs — dashboards, documentation, repositories, monitoring tools — so no one wastes time searching for critical resources.

## Stats Summary

Four summary cards display at the top of the Link Manager:

| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Resources** | The total number of links in your team's repository |
| **Public Access** | Links marked as public (visible to everyone) |
| **Team Restricted** | Links marked as private (visible only to team members) |
| **Total Insights** | Aggregated click/usage count across all links (formatted as `1.2k` for 1200+) |

## Viewing Links

### Three View Modes

Toggle between views using the icons on the right side of the filter bar:

| Icon | View | Best For |
|------|------|---------|
| List icon | **Grid** (default) | Visual cards with full title and category |
| Table icon | **Table** | Dense, spreadsheet-style with sortable columns |
| Grip icon | **Compact** | Minimal rows for maximum density |

### Infinite Scroll

Links are loaded in pages of 30. As you scroll down, additional resources load automatically. A loading indicator appears while fetching, and a summary message shows when all resources are loaded.

## Filtering Links

The **Filter Cockpit** bar combines all controls in one place:

| Control | Options |
|---------|---------|
| **Search** | Type to filter by title, tag, or description (300ms debounce) |
| **Visibility** | Pill buttons: `All` / `Public` / `Private` |
| **Application** | Dropdown: filter by a specific application (shows TLA + name) |
| **Category** | Dropdown: filter by a defined link category |

Active filters appear as removable chips below the filter bar. Click the **X** on any chip to remove that filter individually, or use **Clear all** to reset.

## Adding a Link

Click the **"+ Add Link"** button in the page header to open the Create Link Dialog.

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **URL** | The full URL of the resource |
| **Title** | A short, descriptive name |
| **Application** | Associate the link with a specific application |
| **Category** | Assign an existing category (or leave uncategorized) |
| **Visibility** | Choose `Public` or `Private` |

## Editing & Deleting Links

Each link card has an action menu with:
- **Edit** — Opens the edit dialog to update any field
- **Delete** — Removes the link from the repository

## Bulk Actions

Select multiple links by clicking checkboxes (in Grid and Table views). Once one or more links are selected, the **Bulk Actions Bar** slides in:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Make Public** | Sets all selected links to public visibility |
| **Make Private** | Sets all selected links to private visibility |
| **Assign Category** | Dropdown to assign a category to all selected links at once |
| **Select All Page** | Selects all 30 links on the current loaded page |
| **Clear Selection** | Deselects all |

> [!NOTE]
> Bulk category assignment can also set links to "No Category" by selecting that option from the dropdown.
