# Link Categories

Categories help organize your team's links into logical groups. They appear as options in the **Category filter** on the main Link Manager page and in the **Create/Edit Link** dialog.

---

## Managing Categories

Navigate to **Link Manager → Categories** (or visit `/teams/[teamId]/link-manager/categories`) to view and manage your available categories.

From this page you can:
- **Create** new categories with a custom name and color
- **Edit** existing categories
- **Delete** categories (links assigned to a deleted category will become uncategorized)

## Using Categories

When adding or editing a link, select a category from the dropdown. Only categories created for your team appear in the list.

In the main Link Manager view, the **Category filter** lets you narrow results to a specific category instantly.

> [!TIP]
> Naming convention suggestion: Use consistent, descriptive names like `Monitoring`, `Documentation`, `Infrastructure`, `Source Code`, `Runbooks` to keep your repository organized.
