The **Link Stats** page (accessible via `/teams/[teamId]/link-manager/stats`) provides aggregated usage analytics for all links in your team's repository.

## What is Tracked?

Each time a link is clicked or accessed through Ensemble, that interaction is recorded as a usage event. The Stats page reflects this aggregated data.

## Metrics Shown

- **Most Clicked Links** — Top links ranked by total usage count
- **Usage Trends** — How link access patterns change over time
- **Links with Zero Usage** — Resources that may need review or removal

> [!NOTE]
> Stats are scoped to your team. Cross-team link usage is not visible here.
