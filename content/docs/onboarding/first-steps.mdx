# First Steps After Approval

Once an administrator approves your team registration, you can immediately start using all Ensemble tools. Here is a recommended checklist to get the most out of the platform quickly.

## ✅ Recommended Checklist

### 1. Select Your Team

Use the **Team Switcher** in the navigation header to select your newly activated team. Your last active team is remembered in your browser for quick access next time.

### 2. Configure Applications in Settings

Go to **Settings → Applications** to add the applications your team manages. Applications are required before using the Scorecard and Turnover tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without at least one application configured, Scorecard and Turnover will display an empty state directing you to Settings.

### 3. Set Up Link Manager

Navigate to **Link Manager** and start adding your team's important URLs. Click the **"+ Add Link"** button. You can organize links by:
- **Application** (e.g., KMS, TKS)
- **Category** (e.g., Monitoring, Documentation)
- **Visibility** — choose `Public` (visible to all) or `Private` (team-only)

### 4. Log Your First Turnover Entry

Go to **Turnover → Pass the Baton**. Select your application tab and add an entry to one of the six sections: **RFC, INC, ALERTS, MIM, COMMS, or FYI**.

### 5. Explore the Scorecard

Head to **Scorecard** to see the metrics dashboard. If you have just added applications, start logging availability and volume data entries to populate the charts.
