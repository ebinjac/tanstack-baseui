# Onboarding

Ensemble uses a **team-based access model**. Every tool you use (Scorecard, Turnover, Link Manager) is scoped to a specific team. To get started, you must register your team and have it approved by an administrator.

## The 3-Step Process

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐
│  1. Define Team │ →  │ 2. Secure Access  │ →  │ 3. Get Approved   │
│  Name & Details │    │  (AD Groups)      │    │  & Start Using    │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └───────────────────┘
```

1. **Register**: Fill out the Team Registration form at `/teams/register`
2. **Configure Access**: Provide your Active Directory group names
3. **Submit & Wait for Approval**: An admin reviews and activates your team

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Access is controlled via **Active Directory (AD) groups**. You must have valid, active AD groups for both regular users and administrators before registering.
