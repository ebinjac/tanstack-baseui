# Scorecard

The **Scorecard** is your team's central view for tracking application health, availability, and transaction volume. It aggregates data across all applications configured for your team and presents it in a clean, filterable table and metric visualizations.

## The Stats Row

At the top of the Scorecard, five live statistics are shown for the currently selected time period:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-----------|
| **Applications** | Total number of applications being tracked for your team |
| **Tracked Tech** | Total number of individual scorecard entries (tech records) logged |
| **Availability** | Count of availability records within the selected filter period |
| **Volume Log** | Count of volume records within the selected filter period |
| **SLA Breaches** | Count of records that breached SLA within the selected filter period. Displays in red when non-zero. |

## Viewing & Filtering Data

### View Modes

The main table supports two view modes, toggled via the **Period / Year** tab:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|---------|
| **Period** | Filter by a rolling time window (e.g., Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, This Year) |
| **Year** | Filter by a specific calendar year |

### Period Filter Options

When in **Period** mode, the dropdown provides rolling time window options. These correctly span across year boundaries. For example, "Last 3 Months" selected in February will include January, December (previous year), and November (previous year).

### Expanding Application Rows

Each application has its own collapsible section in the table. Use:
- **Expand All / Collapse All** button in the toolbar to toggle all sections at once
- Click on any application row to expand or collapse it individually

- Select one or more applications to compare
- Each application is shown as a separate colored line or bar
- Switch between chart types (Line, Bar, Area) using the chart toolbar
- Hover over data points to see exact values for that month
- Volume numbers are formatted for readability (e.g., `1.5M`, `2.3B`)

## Admin-Only: Publish & Sync

If you have an **Admin** role for your team, you will see an additional **Sync Status Bar** below the stats row.

### Sync States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Fully Synchronized** (green) | All months are published and up-to-date |
| **Sync Required** (orange, pulsing) | There are unpublished or pending changes |

Month pills appear next to the sync message, color-coded as follows:

| Color | Indicates |
|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Green | Published and synchronized |
| 🟠 Orange | Pending changes (click to publish) |
| 🟡 Amber | Unpublished (click to publish) |

Click a month pill to **Publish** or **Unpublish** that month's data. A confirmation dialog appears before any action is taken.

> [!CAUTION]
> Unpublishing hides data from the Enterprise Scorecard for all users. This can be reversed by publishing again.

## Adding & Editing Entries (Admins Only)

Admins can add, edit, and delete scorecard entries within each expanded application section.

- **Add Entry**: Click the **"+ Add Entry"** button within an application section
- **Edit Entry**: Click the edit icon on any entry row
- **Delete Entry**: Click the delete icon and confirm in the alert dialog

## Enterprise Scorecard

The **Enterprise View** button in the header navigates to the global Scorecard (`/scorecard`), where you can see published data across all teams — useful for leadership reviews.
