# Understanding Metrics

The Scorecard visualizes several key performance indicators. Understanding these metrics is crucial for tracking your team's operational health.

## Visualizations

When you click on a specific metric card, a detailed chart view opens. 

### Interactive Chart

- **Multi-App View**: You can select one or more applications to view on the same chart. Each application is represented by a dynamically assigned color line or bar.
- **Hover Data**: Hovering over data points on the chart reveals exact values for that specific period.
- **Chart Toolbar**: Located at the top right of the chart area, allowing you to switch chart types or toggle legend visibility.

## Rolling Time Filters

The time filters on the Scorecard use a "rolling" window. For example:

- **Last 3 Months**: Includes the current month and the two preceding months. This correctly spans across year boundaries (e.g., viewing in February includes January and December of the previous year).

## Big Data Formatting

For metrics that deal with very large volumes (like total API requests), the numbers are formatted for readability:
- Values in millions are appended with an `M` (e.g., 1.5M).
- Values in billions are appended with a `B` (e.g., 2.3B).
