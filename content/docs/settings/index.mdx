# Settings & Preferences

Ensemble has two levels of settings: **User-level** (personal preferences) and **Team-level** (configuration for your team workspace).

---

## User Preferences

User preferences are accessed via the **Profile Dropdown** in the top navigation header.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Refresh Permissions** | Re-fetches your latest access levels. Use this if an admin recently approved a new role or team access for you, and it hasn't taken effect yet. |
| **Theme Toggle** | Switch between Light and Dark mode |

---

## Team Settings

Navigate to **Settings** from your team's navigation. This page is only fully accessible to users with an **Admin** role in the current team.

### General

- **Team Name**: Update the display name of your team on the platform

### Applications

This is where you **add and manage applications** for your team. Applications are shared across:
- **Scorecard** (each application gets its own section in the metrics table)
- **Turnover / Pass the Baton** (each application gets its own tab)
- **Link Manager** (links can be associated with a specific application)

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Application Name** | The full name (e.g., "Key Management Services") |
| **TLA** | Three-Letter Acronym used as a short badge (e.g., `KMS`) |
| **Tier** | Criticality tier (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2) — shown in Dispatch Turnover |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Removing an application from settings will affect the Scorecard, Turnover, and Link Manager pages for that application. Proceed with caution.
