# Dispatch Turnover

**Dispatch Turnover** is the final step of the shift process. This page compiles all active entries from *Pass the Baton* into a structured, reviewable summary before you officially hand over to the incoming shift.

## Stats Summary

Three summary cards appear at the top of the page:

| Card | What it shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Active Applications** | Count of unique applications that have open entries |
| **Total Entries** | Total number of all open turnover entries |
| **Critical Items** | Number of entries marked as Important (shown in amber if non-zero) |

## Filtering the View

Use the **search bar** in the page header to filter entries by:
- Entry title
- Description content
- Creator name

Use **Expand All View / Collapse All View** to toggle all application accordions at once.

## Application Accordions

Entries are grouped by application. Each collapsible card shows:

- The **Application Name** and **TLA badge** (e.g., `KMS`)
- The **Tier** (e.g., Tier 1, Tier 2)
- Count of items in that application
- A **"Critical"** orange badge if any entry within is marked as Important
- A left border — **orange** for critical applications, **blue** for normal

Expand an accordion to see entries organized by section (RFC, INC, ALERTS, etc.).

## Finalize Turnover

When you are ready to hand over, click **"Finalize Turnover"**. This opens a confirmation dialog.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Finalize button is **disabled** if:
> - There are no active entries to dispatch
> - A **cooldown period** is still active (a recent finalization was made too recently)

### Finalize Dialog

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Shift Intelligence Notes** | An optional high-level summary or specific instructions for the incoming shift (e.g., known issues, pending actions) |

A summary panel within the dialog shows:
- Active Applications count
- Total Handover Items count
- Critical Intensity (number of high priority items)

Click **"Authorize Finalization"** to confirm. This creates a permanent, immutable snapshot stored in **Transition History**.

### Cooldown

After finalizing, a **cooldown period** prevents immediate re-finalization. If the cooldown is active, a banner appears with:
```
🕐 Turnover Finalization Cooldown
[Message explaining when you can finalize again]
```
