# Transition History

**Transition History** is the permanent archive of every finalized shift handover. It provides a full audit trail for operations review, incident post-mortems, and compliance.

## Browsing the Archive

### View Modes

Toggle between **Grid** and **List** view using the buttons in the page header:

| Mode | Best For |
|------|---------|
| **Grid** (default) | Visual scanning, seeing multiple records at a glance |
| **List** | Dense information, viewing notes inline |

Both views show:
- Date and time of finalization
- Finalizer's name (shown with initials avatar)
- Number of applications and total entries in that snapshot
- Orange star badge if the snapshot contained critical items

### Filtering Records

**Search**: Type in the search bar to filter by notes text, finalizer name, or other content.

**Date Range**: Click the **"Pick a date range"** button to open a two-month calendar picker. Select a start and end date to filter records within that window.

Click **"Clear filters"** to reset all active filters.

### Pagination

Records are paginated with 20 per page. Use **Previous / Next** buttons at the bottom, with a current page indicator (e.g., `2 / 5`).

## Viewing a Snapshot

### Snapshot Dialog Contents

The dialog header shows:
- Date and time the turnover was finalized
- The name of the person who finalized it

Inside the scrollable content:
- A **filter bar** to search within this snapshot's entries (by title, description, creator, RFC/INC numbers, etc.)
- **Shift Notes** box (amber) if the finalizer added notes during the Finalize dialog
- Collapsible **application accordion** groups, each expandable to reveal entries by section (MIM, INC, RFC, ALERTS, COMMS, FYI — sorted in priority order)

Each entry within the snapshot is displayed in **read-only** mode with all original field values preserved.
