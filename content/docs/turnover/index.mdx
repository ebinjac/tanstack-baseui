# Turnover Portal — TO-HUB

The **Turnover Portal** (displayed as **TO-HUB** in the sidebar) is a structured shift handover system. It ensures that every detail an incoming shift needs to know is captured, organized, and preserved.

## Sidebar Navigation

The TO-HUB uses a dedicated collapsible sidebar for navigation. Click the panel toggle icon at the top to collapse or expand it. When collapsed, icons are still visible with tooltips on hover.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [Pass the Baton](/docs/turnover/pass-the-baton) | Log active entries for the current shift |
| [Dispatch Turnover](/docs/turnover/dispatch) | Review and finalize the shift for handover |
| [Transition History](/docs/turnover/history) | Browse all past finalized turnovers |
| Turnover Metrics | *(Coming Soon)* Analytics and performance data |

The **Back** button at the top of the sidebar takes you back to the main Settings page for your team.

## How the Workflow Works

```
Log Entries           Review & Finalize        Archive
(Pass the Baton)  →  (Dispatch Turnover)  →  (Transition History)
```

1. The outgoing shift logs events and tasks in **Pass the Baton**
2. Before the shift ends, they open **Dispatch Turnover** to review the full summary
3. They click **"Finalize Turnover"** to create a permanent, immutable snapshot
4. The snapshot is saved in **Transition History** for the incoming shift to review

## Six Entry Sections

All turnover entries are categorized into one of 6 standard sections used across Pass the Baton and Dispatch Turnover:

| Code | Full Name | Color |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **RFC** | Request for Change | Blue |
| **INC** | Incident | Red |
| **ALERTS** | Alerts | Amber |
| **MIM** | Major Incident Management | Purple |
| **COMMS** | Communications | Green |
| **FYI** | For Your Information | Gray |
