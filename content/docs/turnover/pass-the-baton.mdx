# Pass the Baton

**Pass the Baton** is the active logbook for the current shift. Here, team members log every event, change, incident, and communication that the next shift needs to be aware of.

## Application Tabs

At the top of the page, you'll see tabs for each application (or group) your team manages.

### Flat Tabs (Default)
When no groups are configured, each application appears as its own tab labeled by its **TLA** (Three-Letter Acronym), e.g., `KMS`, `TKS`, `AIF`.

### Grouped Tabs
If your admin has configured application groups (e.g., `KMS/TKS`), grouped tabs appear instead. A group must contain **at least 2 applications** to be valid. The **"Grouped View"** toggle and badge showing the group count appear in the header.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Grouped View** switch is informational. To create or modify groups, click the **"Manage Groups"** or **"Create Groups"** button.

## Critical Items Alert

If any entry within the active application tab is marked as **Important**, a prominent orange warning banner appears at the top of the page.

```
⚠️ Critical Turnover Items — X items
"Action required: These items have been flagged for immediate attention."
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always address critical items before ending your shift.

## Section Tables

The main area shows a **2-column grid** of the six standard sections:

| Section | Icon Description |
|---------|----------------|
| **RFC** (Request for Change) | Active change tickets being tracked this shift |
| **INC** (Incident) | Open or recently resolved incidents |
| **ALERTS** | Monitoring alerts triggered during the shift |
| **MIM** (Major Incident Management) | Critical outage records |
| **COMMS** (Communications) | Email threads or announcements relevant to the shift |
| **FYI** (For Your Information) | General notes, reminders, or interesting findings |

### Adding an Entry

Within any section table, click the **"+ Add"** button to open the Entry Dialog.

**Entry Dialog Fields:**

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| **Application** | If viewing a grouped tab, you must select which specific application this entry applies to |
| **Title** | A brief, descriptive title |
| **Description** | Detailed context or steps |
| **Section** | Pre-selected based on which table you clicked |
| **Mark as Important** | Flags the entry as critical, triggering the orange alert banner |

For **RFC** entries, additional fields appear: RFC Number, RFC Status, and Validated By.
For **INC** entries: Incident Number is shown.
For **MIM** entries: MIM Link is shown.
For **COMMS** entries: Email Subject is shown.

### Editing & Resolving Entries

Each entry card shows inline actions:
- **Edit**: Update any field on the entry
- **Resolve / Unresolve**: Mark the item as handled (recently resolved items may still appear briefly)
- **Delete**: Remove the entry entirely

## No Applications Configured?

If your team has no applications set up, Pass the Baton shows an empty state with a button to **"Go to Settings to Add Applications"**. Contact your team admin to configure applications first.
